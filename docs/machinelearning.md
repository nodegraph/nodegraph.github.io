Node graphs have recently become a popular way to visualize and control neural networks used machine learning. A node in the node graph is often used to represent a layer in the nerual network.

The follwoing are the 2 most popular deep learning frameworks. They don't provide a graphical user interface for the layers in the neural networks.

* [PyTorch, GitHub, Facebook](https://pytorch.org)
* [TensorFlow, GitHub, Google](https://www.tensorflow.org)

The following are some examples of applications providing graphical node graph interfaces to make it easier to design and debug neural networks.
